#Exampel of using a dev-container for development.

Here we are trying to use a dev-container for local development, 
we take here python with poetry for environment.

To run poetry we hat some thinks to setup:

- https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/
	- poetry config virtualenvs.in-project --local
	to create a local configuration file
	- setup the test and virtual environment for vscode in the vscode settings.
